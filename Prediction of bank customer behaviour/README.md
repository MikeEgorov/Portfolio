[`ipynb`](https://github.com/mike2023-ml/Portfolio/blob/main/Prediction%20of%20bank%20customer%20behaviour/test.ipynb)  

**Project Tasks:**  
*To predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not.*

***

**Project Description:**  
*Customers started leaving the bank. Bank marketers have calculated that it is cheaper to keep current clients than to attract new ones. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on customer behaviour and termination of contracts with the bank for three months is provided.*

***

**Project Conclusions:**  
*Based on the results of the data analysis, a model is built which helps to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not.
The model has shown the result that is much better than the random one, the model can be applied.*
